I am a final-year PhD student in the [Computer Systems Lab](http://csl.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu), working under the supervision of [Professor Anurag Khandelwal](http://anuragkhandelwal.com). My research interests include distributed systems, memory disaggregation, serverless computing and hardware accelerators. 

I have gained value experience as a research intern at several prestigious institutions, including [Bytedance, Inc.](https://www.bytedance.com/en/)(2023, 2024), [Xilinx Asia Research lab](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga.html)(2020), [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/)(2019), and [RISELab at UC Berkeley](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/)(2018, 2019).
