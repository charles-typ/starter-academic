abstract: Stateful serverless analytics can be enabled using a remote memory system
  for inter-task communication, and for storing and exchanging intermediate data.
  However, existing systems allocate memory resources at job granularity---jobs specify
  their memory demands at the time of the submission; and, the system allocates memory
  equal to the job's demand for the entirety of its lifetime. This leads to resource
  underutilization and/or performance degradation when intermediate data sizes vary
  during job execution.This paper presents Jiffy, an elastic far-memory system for
  stateful serverless analytics that meets the instantaneous memory demand of a job
  at seconds timescales. Jiffy efficiently multiplexes memory capacity across concurrently
  running jobs, reducing the overheads of reads and writes to slower persistent storage,
  resulting in 1.6 -- 2.5Ã— improvements in job execution time over production workloads.
  Jiffy implementation currently runs on Amazon EC2, enables a wide variety of distributed
  programming models including MapReduce, Dryad, StreamScope, and Piccolo, and natively
  supports a large class of analytics applications on AWS Lambda.
